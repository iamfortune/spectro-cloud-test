# Education Engineer Assignment Submission

This repository contains my submission for the Education Engineer role at Spectro Cloud.

## What I Changed

I rewrote the Kubernetes tutorial to improve the learning experience for beginners. The main improvements include:

- **Better structure**: Reorganized content to follow a logical flow from setup to deployment to cleanup
- **Clearer explanations**: Added context before commands so readers understand what they're doing and why
- **Cleaned up YAML**: Removed unnecessary metadata fields and fixed the incorrect Azure reference
- **Added verification steps**: Included outputs after each command so readers can confirm they're on track
- **Beginner-friendly language**: Explained Kubernetes concepts like Deployments and Services before using them

## Key Changes

- Added a proper introduction that explains what Kind is and what readers will learn
- Created a Prerequisites section with all required tools
- Split the deployment section into smaller, digestible steps
- Added explanations for the YAML manifest components
- Included verification commands throughout
- Wrote a summary in Next Steps that reinforces what was learned

All changes follow the provided [style guide](https://github.com/spectrocloud/docs-assignments/blob/main/style_guide.md) and [layout guide](https://github.com/spectrocloud/docs-assignments/blob/main/education-engineer/layout.md) requirements.
